lirc (0.9.0~pre1-1) unstable; urgency=low

    lirc_cmdir has been dropped upstream in favour of a userspace module 
    (commandir). lirc_ene0100, lirc_imon, lirc_mceusb/ lirc_mceusb2 and
    lirc_streamzap have been ported to the new RC_CORE input subsystem, which
    requires different configuration methods and "ir-keytable" for keytable 
    upload.

    lirc-modules-source has been superseded by kernel >= 2.6.37, which has
    merged lirc under staging. Conversion of traditional lirc modules to the
    new RC_CORE subsystem is still ongoing and may require config adaptions for
    newly ported modules.

    The kernel/ userspace ABI between staging lirc modules in the upstream
    kernel and those provided by previous lirc-modules-source packages is not
    compatible, only >= 0.9~ userspace and staging kernel modules from 
    >= 2.6.37 can cooperate.

    lirc-svga (smode2) has been dropped in favour of lirc-x (xmode2) or mode2
    from the main lirc binary.
